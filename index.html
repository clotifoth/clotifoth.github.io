                        <p>Welcome to my professional abode! I'm Frederick Brunn, and I'm a web developer with a B.S. in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. I'm very interested in the user experience and thus I aim to ask just the right questions to further understand the user requirements, ensuring the development of an optimal product. In particular, I like designing front-end user interfaces, but I also have experience writing back-end code. When I'm relaxing, I enjoy studying world history, playing roguelikes and retro games, and discovering new music of all genres.
