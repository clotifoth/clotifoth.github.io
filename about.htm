<h2>About this site.</h2>

<p>This website was designed with the goal of being lightweight, first and foremost. Many websites are bogged down with copious Javascript components. I feel that while these have a place in website design, they have downsides such as incompatibility with older browsers and high bandwidth requirements. By restricting this website to CSS and HTML elements, I can ensure that this website will look as-designed on most modern browsers. Likewise, connections will be able to access this page quickly regardless of their bandwidth.</p>

<p>I built this website for the purpose of showcasing my projects and r&eacute;sum&eacute; in an easy-to-access, convenient, and eye-pleasing format. I like the prospect of being able to give interested parties a link to this website and immediately having access to my portfolio with minimum hassle. As well, a complete website kept recent over time is a good example of a long-term project continually worked on and improved- in itself, this website forms part of my portfolio.</p>
